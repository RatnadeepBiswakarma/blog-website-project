            <h2>His mother had always taught him</h2>
            <p>
              His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as
              better than others. He'd tried to live by this motto. He never
              looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money
              than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking
              to made him change his mind.

            <p>
              He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully
              appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the
              soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a
              perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect
              and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it.

            <p>
              Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles
              from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was
              inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through
              his mental list of the most important papers and documents that
              they couldn't leave behind.

            <p>
              All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult
              request to comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen and didn't
              seem to want to honor the request. It might have had something to
              do with the gun pointed at his face.
